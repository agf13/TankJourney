This is played in the console (command line).
Open cmd and run main.py using a python compiler.

Levels are found in the folder named "repositories". To add a new level, just create a new file in the folder and name it level + some identifier.txt (ex: level1.txt, levelZZ.txt). Design the walls using the ascii characters: | or _ and the starting place of a tank by using the symbol S. You can have as many players as the number of S's. The interior of the designed mad should contain spaces. Tabs are not read (in other words, the tank can only move on space characters).

Description of the game:
	you are a tank and you can move arround by typing any of the keys w,a,s or d, then enter.
	you can move multiple fields in one direction by using key + number (ex: a 20 -> moves 20 spaces to the left)
	at the start of the level, chose whether the camera should see the entire map, or just a portion around the player (and then moving with the player).
